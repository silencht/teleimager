# Tele Imager

## 1. Image Server

This module provides an image server that captures video streams from multiple cameras (UVC„ÄÅOpenCV and RealSense) and publishes the frames over a network using ZeroMQ. It is designed to support teleoperation applications where real-time video streaming is essential. 

All user-callable functions are listed below the `# public api` comment in the code.

### 1.0 ‚ú® Features

- üì∏ Supports multiple UVC, OpenCV and Intel RealSense cameras.
- üì¢ Publishes video frames using ZeroMQ PUB-SUB pattern.
- üöß (TODO)  LocalHost shared memory mode for low-latency frame access.
- üí¨ Response image configuration via ZeroMQ REQ-REP pattern.
- üÜî Multi Camera identifiers (choose one or more): physical path, serial number and video device path.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable frame resolution and frame rate.
- üöÄ Efficient frame handling using a triple ring buffer.

### 1.1 üì• Environment Setup

You can set up TeleImager using either a Conda environment or the system (base) environment.
Both methods work ‚Äî choose whichever fits your workflow better.

#### 1.1.1 Conda Environment
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/silencht/teleimager.git
    cd teleimager
    ```
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    conda create -n teleimager python=3.10 -y
    conda activate teleimager
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y libusb-1.0-0-dev libturbojpeg-dev 
    pip install -e .
    ```
#### 1.1.2 Base Environment
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/silencht/teleimager.git
    cd teleimager
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
    sudo apt install -y libusb-1.0-0-dev libturbojpeg-dev
    sudo pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    pip install .
   ```

### 1.2 üîç Finding connected cameras

To discover connected cameras, run the following command in the terminal. 
`sudo $(which python)` is used to ensure the script has the necessary permissions to access camera devices. And `--cf` means "camera find". 
```bash
(teleimager) unitree@unitree:~/image_server$ sudo $(which python) image_server.py --cf
```

You should see output similar to the following, which lists all detected UVC cameras and their details:

```bash
(teleimager) unitree@unitree:~/xr_teleoperate/teleop/image_server$ sudo $(which python) image_server.py --cf

```

### 1.3 üì° Starting the Image Server
According to the camera discovery results up, you can fill `cam_config.yaml` with the results. Here is an example configuration file,

```yaml
# cam_config.yaml, All parameters are explained in the comments.
# =====================================================
# Head camera configuration
# =====================================================
# camera topic
head_camera:
  # camera configuration

  # Set to true to enable this camera, false to disable
  enable: true

  # Port to publish camera stream, i.e. zmq tcp://*:55555.  image_client.py should connect to the same port
  port : 55555

  # Type of camera:
  #   - "opencv"    ‚Üí opencv driver
  #   - "realsense" ‚Üí pyrealsense2 driver
  #   - "uvc"       ‚Üí pyuvc driver  (Recommended)
  type: uvc

  # Image Format
  # image resolution: [height, width]
  image_shape: [480, 1280]

  # frame per second
  fps: 60

  # Camera identifiers (choose one or more):
  #   - video_id: X        ‚Üí /dev/videoX  (e.g. 0 ‚Üí /dev/video0)
  #   - serial_number: Y   ‚Üí camera's hardware serial (e.g. 141722079879)
  #   - physical_path: Z   ‚Üí sysfs physical USB path (e.g. /sys/devices/pci0000:00/.../1-11.2:1.0)
  #
  # Identifier priority:
  #   physical_path > serial_number > video_id
  #   if an identifier is not used, set it to null. The system will resolve the camera by priority.
  #
  # Notes:
  #   - type "realsense": supports serial_number only (but a RealSense can also be used as opencv/uvc if desired)
  #   - type "opencv":    supports video_id, serial_number, physical_path
  #   - type "uvc":       supports video_id, serial_number, physical_path

  # - If camera's serial_numbers is unique, you could just use serial_number to identify them. Unfortunately,
  #   some (low-cost) cameras may have the same serial_number. In this case, you could use physical_path to identify them.
  # - So, if you are sure that camera would always be plugged into the same USB port, you could use physical_path.
  #   physical_path is the most robust way to identify a camera, but it is not flexible: 
  #   if you change camera to plug into another USB port, then you need to change the physical_path in the config file.
  # - Finally, video_id is the most fragile way to identify a camera, because it may change when camera plug in order changes.
  #   but if you just want to use video_id, please make sure to set physical_path and serial_number to null!
  #   once you specify either `physical_path` or `serial_number`, the system will no longer fall back to searching by `video_id`.
  #   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî even if no camera matches the given path/serial.
  video_id: 2                    # according to the discovery result, you could find the UVC Camera2's video_path is /dev/video2
  serial_number: 01.00.00        # you could find the UVC Camera2's serial_number is 01.00.00
  physical_path: null            # you could find the UVC Camera2's physical_path is /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-11/1-11.1/1-11.1:1.0
                                 # for flexibility, we set it to null here, so the system will resolve the camera by serial_number.

## 2. Image Client
This module provides an image client that connects to the image server to receive and display video streams from multiple cameras. It is designed to work with the image server for teleoperation applications.

All user-callable functions are listed below the `# public api` comment in the code.

### 2.1 üéØ Usage
When the image server is running, you can start the image client to receive and display the video streams. Run the following command in another terminal:
```bash
python image_client.py
```
Maybe you need to change the host ip and camera port in `image_client.py` to match the server settings.
For example, if the server is running on Unitree G1 Jetson Nx machine with IP address `192.168.123.164`, you should change the host in `image_client.py` like this:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage with three camera streams
    client = ImageClient(host='192.168.123.164')  # Change to the server's IP address
#...
```
> Remember to have the **opencv-python** library installed in your environment.

Then you should see the video streams from the cameras in separate OpenCV windows.
